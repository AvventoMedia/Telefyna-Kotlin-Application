## Installation
* Download the [Coming Soon]() and install it, grant the app Storage permission and reload it if necessary

## Configurations
* User the [online configuration application](https://avventomedia.org/telefyna/configuration.html) to build and export your `config.json`
* Visit SDcard/drive or device storage without SDcard/drive and add a local `telefyna` folder playlist folder containing your local programs folder (`playlist`) and `config.json` file
* Ensure the telefyna app is granted storage permission in your permissions
* Telefyna logs audits onto `telefynaAudit` on the device storage
* Maintenance automatically runs at midnight each day and schedules programs for the starting day
* To tell Telefyna to reload any time you need to add `init.txt` file in `telefynaAudit` folder and it will reload on next program
* A started slot can't be updated even if you change programs, or schedule. changes can only affect the next schedule and following

### Device
* set `notificationsDisabled` to false to disable notifications
* set `automationDisabled` to true to disable and only use the first playlist

### Remote access
* If you want to access the filesystem remove, run an [FTP app like swiftp](https://github.com/avventoapps/avvento/releases/latest/download/swiftp.apk)
* You can use FTP clients like [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) or [RustDesk](https://rustdesk.com/) to upload both revised `config.json` and `playlist` folder/contents
* Alternatively you can auto sync local to device folder with something like [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)
* You can do the same `telefynaAudit` folder which is the internal device storage root path

### Playlist
* Ensure the device's Date and Timezone are set correctly
* The first playlist is the default  playlist and is used as a filler if nothing is available to play next or local folder is vacant
* The second playlist is a second default, it's a second filler choice and is played when `ONLINE` ones fail because of of internet issues
* If an internet connection is lost during a broadcast, the second playlist is defaulted to and if it's restored, the previous program will be restored too
* Both the above two default playlists must be maintained active, if any of them is local, better set resuming
* If you intend to use one playlist as default for both the first and second, make the second a schedule of the first
* `name` your playlist meaningfully
* `description` contains your explanation of about the playlist
* `days` of the week (`1-7`=Sun-Sat): if null or not defined, runs daily
* `dates` to schedule playlist for, date format must be `dd-MM-yyyy`
* Playlist `start` should be in format `HH:mm` eg `12:00` for mid-day, hours are in 24 hour
* `urlOrFolder`, stream url or local folder containing alphabetically ordered playlist folders
* For local playlists, if active and nothing is defined or completed, the default playlist will be played
* `type` can either be `ONLINE` (stream/default), or `LOCAL_SEQUENCED` (local ordered folder) or `LOCAL_RESUMING` (local resuming folder), or `LOCAL_RESUMING_SAME` (local resuming from same non completed program), or `LOCAL_RESUMING_NEXT` (local resuming from next program) or `LOCAL_RANDOMIZED` (local random folder)
* For `type`s `LOCAL_SEQUENCED`, `LOCAL_RANDOMIZED`
* Each playlist can load bumpers from 3 or less folders listed below
* You can define bumpers (ads, promos etc) to play as the `LOCAL_SEQUENCED` or `LOCAL_RANDOMIZED` playlist starts in `bumper` folder in a sub folder named same value as your playlist's `urlOrFolder`
* You can add folder named after `specialBumperFolder` value to tag any playlist to play bumpers located in `specialBumperFolder` folder 
* You can add `General` folder in `bumper` folder for general ads to play before all bumpers & programs
* All playlist are enabled by default, to disable one, set `active=false`
* `schedule` allows you to schedule a playlist defined up by its order/number/count (starts from 0) and manage separate/override `start` or `days` or `dates`
* A field left out in config is by default set to `null`
* Ensure to have a playlist completing/ending each local one else the default one will automatically be played

## To Do

---
- [ ] SRT support: [ExoPlayer Issue #8647](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8647)
- [ ] Support auto installation of config under resources if non-existent at first run
- [ ] Make Telefyna device specific; maintain a file with supported device IDs. If not granted, show video demo to help them get in touch at mail@avventomedia.org
- [ ] Investigate playing slot at 20:57. It played from start.
- [ ] Create a Telefyna LOCAL_RANDOMIZED special mode which loads folders and plays one at a time, or set logic for it
- [ ] Test if dates down the playlist overwrite the schedule
- [ ] Test playlist modification, etc.
- [ ] Test and fix midnight runner
- [ ] Test setupLocalPrograms: addedFirstItem
- [ ] Handle current play at switch not buffering video
- [ ] Add stop or change audit event
- [ ] Log every keypress
- [ ] Fix app relaunching, opening a new/duplicate instance rather than resuming
- [ ] Fix Swift bug: don't override, just replace (hack, skip by default, delete copy again) manually
- [ ] Player sometimes plays another in the background
- [ ] Investigate bumpers missing when loaded from scheduler
- [ ] Handle player idling on stream; resume play/seekTo
- [ ] Handle some unknown source error that makes the program switch; retry defaulting back to the program
- [ ] Add support for automatic drive syncing 
- [ ] Fix remote control key events listening not working
- [ ] Add background checker: if player is active and idle for 1 minute, play/switch again
- [ ] **Urgent; INVESTIGATE:** Connecting Bluetooth plays fillers? (17 Mar 21, 18:15). Also, player switches but plays only audio at 18:30.
- [ ] Create user-guide
- [ ] Support triggering reinitialization in the next program
- [ ] Support gifs in showing logo and watermarks

### Links

- [ ] Support YouTube links and streams
- [ ] Look through existing TODOs
- [ ] Locally backup/download streaming content
- [ ] Build reports from audits
- [ ] Write tests
- [ ] Play video with different or additional audio/slave
- [ ] Overlay another layer on the video stream for ads, logos, gifs etc.
- [ ] Read satellite channels and decoders as local playlists and streams
- [ ] Add a way to stream video as only audio (streaming audio only)
- [ ] Support streaming to HLS, Shoutcast, and Loudcast (use external streaming encoder, not supported)
- [ ] Ensure all wrong media files are skipped (blocked)
- [ ] Work on presentation approach

    #### API Level of the Device:
  * On older Android versions (API 28 and below), `Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()` points to shared storage like `emulated/0/`.
  * On newer Android versions (API 29+), your app is confined to its private storage directory under `Android/data/<package>/`.
    This will always resolve to:
  * `emulated/0/Android/data/<package>/ `on newer devices.
    Request Legacy Access for Older Behavior: If you want to write to shared storage like `emulated/0/telefynaAudit` on `Android 10+`, add this to your `AndroidManifest.xml:
    xml`
  
    CopyEdit
  
    `<application
    android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true" ... >
    </application>
    However, this will not work on Android 11+`.
